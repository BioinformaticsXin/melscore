Description: Utilizing the melanoma malignant progression map we've built at single-cell resolution, 'melscore' will deduce the proportions of melanoma cell infiltration linked to various levels of malignancy within bulk samples. Employing a scoring model, 'melscore' could compute the melanoma progression status for each sample, which will serve as a basis for subsequent functional and clinical-related analyses.
